      <h2> FSS Performance Trending </h2>

      <h3> Summary </h3>

      <p>
      The 2012:150 entry to safe mode was caused by the FSS persistently reporting an
      incorrect value (~32 degrees vs. expected value of 0 degrees) for the
      Alpha angle (AOALPANG) while also reporting the Sun Presence flags
      (AOALPSUN and AOBETSUN) as SUN (indicating sun is present and data values
      are valid). This occurred in NPM while the Sun Position Monitor (SPM) was
      active at a sun pitch slightly above 139 degrees. The incorrect Alpha sun
      angle values caused two checks in the SPM to fail.

      <h3> FSS bad data with sun presence  (Updated <!--#CONFIG TIMEFMT="%x"--><!--#flastmod file="pitch_bad_alpha_sun.png"-->)</h3>

      <p>
        The plot belows show the sun pitch angle for data points when the FSS reports
      no sun presence in Alpha (AOAPLSUN = "NSUN") or Beta (AOBETSUN =
      "NSUN"). This illustrates the effective FSS field of view outside of
      which the data are marked invalid. The red points correspond to Kalman
      mode (AOACASEQ = "KALM" and AOPCADMD = "NPNT"). The cyan points are those
      when NOT in Kalman (corresponding mostly to maneuvers).

      <p>
        The big blue dots show "bad" angle data while in sun presence (AOALPSUN
      and AOBETSUN both SUN) with the reported FSS angle more than 10 degrees
      away from the "true" value. These points will be used in the Sun Position
      Monitor if it is active, which is typically the case for NPM dwells and
      maneuvers that are entirely within pitch < 139.0 [2]. All of the blue
      points occurred with the SPM inactive, hence no safe mode entry. The
      single red X represents the point on 2012:150 during NPM that led to the
      safe mode entry.
